Software Renderer:

About: this project is a software renderer written in C++ for Linux systems using the X11 Windowing system.

To run a demo, use `make models` in this repository. You can then use the WASD keys and the space bar to explore a 2d map.

This project is work-in progress. A few of the TODOs are as follows:
1) Sometimes minor scanline errors occur where two triangles meet - identify the source of this and fix.
2) Add a wider variety of demos to demonstrate additional functionality.
3) Parallelise the rendering logic using multithreading.
4) Add support for Win32 - implement Win32 concrete classes for the platform-independent abstraction layer.
